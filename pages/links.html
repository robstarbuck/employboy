			Well you know you're really padding things out when Links is a menu item. But I love sharing things and beneath are some things I hope you find useful.

				<strong>6.</strong><a href="http://www.kelvinluck.com/assets/jquery/jScrollPane/jScrollPane.html" target="_blank">The Kevin Luck Scroller</a>
				</div>
				<p>I took a look at a few jquery scrollers for my site and I thought this one best put together. I've made minor modifications to my own.</p>

				<strong>10.</strong><a href="http://www.alvit.de/handbook/" target="_blank">Web links to web links</a>
